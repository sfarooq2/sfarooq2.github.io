    <p>
        My name is Subhan, and I am aspiring to be a software developer. Over the many years of school I have accumulated 5 years in programming. I have done 3 years of Computer Science at Lillian Osborne High School, 1 year of Programming at the University of Alberta and currently I am doing a 2 year computer engineering program at Nait which I have already completed 1 year. The languages that I have learned over the years are Python, C#, C, Html, Css, Javascript. I am most versed in Python and C#. Some Recent Projects that I have worked on and some upcoming projects I plan on can be found in the Project's section of the website. Contact can be found in the Contact section of the website.
